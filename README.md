# Final Project

An exercise to put to practice software development teamwork, subsystem communication, containers, deployment, and CI/CD pipelines. See [instructions](./instructions.md) for details.

## Introduction

This web-app is an apartment searching app just like Streeteasy but better. (Think of streeteasy + ratemyprofessor!) We allow users to search for apartments in New York based on different filters such as boroughs or price range and more. However, the most important feature that we provide is for users to check the ratings and reviews of the apartments uploaded by the previous tenants. Users can check those reviews from the previous tenants and save the apartments that fit their conditions and interest.

## Deployed Web App

3. Head to [localhost](http://localhost:4001/login) to login or sign up.

### Web App (Admin)

1. The containers for the web app admin use port 5001. Make sure no other app is running on 5001 port.
